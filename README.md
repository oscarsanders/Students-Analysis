# Students Analysis
Exploratory data analysis

This project analyzes the performance of a group of high school students for 6 months in subjects such as mathematics, literature, English, art, sports, biology, history, and physics. We first check the fidelity of the data and then calculate the measures of central tendency through a statistical summary. After that, we visualize the histograms and boxplots as well as the average radar for each subject and student.
