# Students Analysis
Exploratory data analysis

The data provided contain scores of each student in each asignature through four periods of evaluation. The superiors and parents need to know if some of the students need help with one or more asignatures or if she or he need especial treatment according its situation.

It is obvious that some students score very low in some cases. If data isn't normal that means we have outliers. Outliers students tell us a signal that the student need some kind of help or atention. Perhaps teachers are the problem too? Also, the data tell us about performance in each asignature and that reflects some kind of performance of teacher.

The values less than 60 are fail in that period of evaluation.
